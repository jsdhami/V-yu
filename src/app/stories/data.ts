      description:
        "Tropical cyclones are rapidly rotating storm systems that form over warm ocean waters. They have low-pressure centers, strong winds, and heavy rain. The names used for these storms vary depending on their location. Tropical cyclones use warm, moist air as fuel and warmer ocean temperatures provide more fuel, potentially intensifying storms. Warm sea surface temperatures are required for formation and strengthening, with higher temperatures resulting in faster intensification. High ocean heat content allows storms to achieve higher intensities, while faster-moving systems can intensify with lower ocean heat content. Climate change can affect tropical cyclones in various ways, including intensification of rainfall and wind speed, decrease in overall frequency, increase in the frequency of very intense storms, and poleward extension of where cyclones reach maximum intensity.",

        "Navagating the Wildfires: How Climate Change is Affecting the Frequency and Intensity of Wildfires",
      description:
        "Wildfires in grasslands, forests, wildland vegetation, and rural areas are uncontrolled fires and have been occurring for thousands of years. Wildfires can burn in and above the soil. Ground fires can smolder for a long time -even an entire season- until conditions are right for them to grow to surface or crown fire. Wildfires can start with natural occurrences- such as lightning strikes- or a human-made spark. Wind, high temperatures, and little rainfall can all leave trees, shrubs, fallen leaves, and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part too: flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill.",
